## General info
This project is connected with upper body classification challenge. 
We need to classify whether input image contains upper body part or not.
We try to detect upper body parts in given images both training our own CNN-model and also using pretrained models, such us MTCNN and HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFIERS.
Also our aim is to compare models' performance.


## Models comparison for face detection
* Own built CNN model
* MTCNN model ([a link](https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/))
* HAAR CASCADES Classifiers ([a link](https://github.com/parulnith/Face-Detection-in-Python-using-OpenCV/tree/master/data/haarcascades))
